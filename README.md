# Comparison-of-various-clustering-algorithms-DBSCAN-AGM-and-Kmeans-on-Mall_customer-Dataset
 clustering algorithms (DBSCAN,AGM and Kmeans) on Mall_customer  Dataset
 Dataset is less noisy and flat .so,we Kmeans is giving better result 
 We can compare Kmeans algorithm clusters by using Inter cluster and Intra cluster distances and by using entropy within the same clusters .
